# Fill in the Blanks

For this project, you'll be building a Fill-in-the-Blanks quiz.
Your quiz will prompt a user with a paragraph containing several blanks.
The user should then be asked to fill in each blank appropriately to complete the paragraph.
This can be used as a study tool to help you remember important vocabulary!

Note: This program must be run in Terminal or IDLE.
